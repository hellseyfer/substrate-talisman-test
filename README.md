# Encode hackaton app

This is a project based on the Talisman workshop for the Polkadot Hackathon 2024 edition. It is built with Next.js 14, Chakra UI, and Redux Toolkit for state management. Additionally, I utilized the @polkadot/api, @polkadot/extension-dapp, and @polkadot/extension-inject libraries to interact with the blockchain. The demonstration was conducted in the Westend testnet environment. Moreover, I employed the @talismn/siws library for backend authentication using the wallet.

it provides the following functionalities:

- Wallet connection
- Address selector
- Balance checking
- Backend authentication
- Transfer funds
